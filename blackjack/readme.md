# Blackjack
Completed on Day 11 of 100 Days of Python

Fully functional CLI Blackjack game covering all typical edge cases. Includes two versions because I found a major improvement mid-way and preserved the original as well.  
Skills learned: Game logic, modular design, edge case handling, functions with outputs, loops, conditionals.

Update: Improved blackjack to remove redundant code
