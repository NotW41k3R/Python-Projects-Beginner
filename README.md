# Python Projects - Beginner

A collection of beginner-level Python projects built as part of the 100 Days of Python course.
This repository focuses on building a strong foundation in core Python concepts through small, self-contained command-line projects.

Each folder represents an individual exercise or mini-project designed to reinforce fundamentals through practical implementation .


## Topics covered

* Variables, data types, and type conversion
* String manipulation and user input/output
* Conditional logic and logical operators
* Loops (`for`, `while`) and control flow
* Functions, arguments, and return values
* Lists, dictionaries, and nested data structures
* Randomisation and basic game logic
* Scope, debugging techniques, and error handling
* Code structure, indentation, and flowchart-based thinking


## Project style

* Simple CLI-based programs
* Focus on logic clarity over optimization
* Incremental improvements preserved where relevant
* Each project includes a short README describing functionality and learnings


## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning log and progress tracker, capturing the transition from Python basics to more structured problem-solving and modular code design.
