Compare the Instagram Followers of F1 Drivers, Teams and Team Principals

Intergating my love for Formula 1 into a Higher Lower game

Currently this is CLI Based and follower count will get outdated by time but,
My Goal is to keep returning to this one to keep adding things i learn

    -Pull live follower counts from Twitter/Instagram APIs (so the numbers actually change over time)
    -Use ASCII art or color (like red/green) for correct vs wrong
    -Turn it into a small Flask web app one day
        -This will add more functionality such as Twitter comparision or Insta Comparision
        -Add a Photo of the dude next to the follower count 
        -and much more that i could find while learning Python
