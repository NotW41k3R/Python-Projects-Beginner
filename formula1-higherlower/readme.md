# F1 Higher Lower
Completed on Day 14 of 100 Days of Python

Compare the Instagram followers of F1 Drivers, Teams, and Team Principals in a CLI game.  
This project integrates my love for Formula 1 into coding, and it's meant to be a living project, I plan to keep enhancing it as I learn more.

Planned improvements:
- Pull live follower counts from Twitter/Instagram APIs so the numbers update in real-time.
- Use ASCII art or colors (like red/green) for correct vs wrong answers.
- Turn it into a small Flask web app one day:
    - Include Twitter/Instagram comparisons.
    - Display profile photos next to follower counts.
    - Add more interactive features as I learn Python.
